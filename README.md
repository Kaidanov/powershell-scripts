## Comment-Ssms2016TfsPkgUndef.ps1
Developed to quickly comment out the TFS SCC packages in the SSMS 2016 PkgUndef file. Commenting out those lines will tell the Visual Studio 2015 shell for SSMS 2016 to load the TFS SCC packages. That will in turn enable TFS source code integration within SQL Server Management Studio 2016.
